## 2026-10-19 — Lane 2: sprint branches integrated (wire disconnect, Properties overhaul, viewer colour on the card)

- **What was done:** Lane 2's branch was reset to `main` (0.39.0; backup branch `backup/nb-2d-parity-pre-sprints-1019`) and
  the three finished 10/18 sprint branches were brought in by cherry-pick: `wire-disconnect-1018` (5 commits, clean),
  `props-overhaul-1018` (5 commits, clean; ColorCorrect migration is schema 24 -> 25, main was at 24), and the five
  commits of `astra-sprint-a-1018` that were not already on main (its first four are main's VP1 commits). Conflicts in
  `nodebased/directviewer.py` kept main's device-loss recovery, Wayland refusal and `needs_wgpu` skips and added the
  card display transform on top: recovery and close now also release the float texture, the retained frame for
  recovery is the whole ledger payload (QImage or linear), and close skips its idle wait on a device already lost.
  `docs/DIRECT_VIEWER.md` keeps main's known-gaps list with the sprint's colour and playback notes merged in.
- **CI fixes:** (1) props-overhaul's exit -11 in `tests.test_knob_sliders` was a stack overflow: with CI's DejaVu
  fonts PointsTo3D's x/y `WrappingRow` fit on one line only while the Properties scroll bar was hidden, so the row and
  the bar flipped each other through QScrollArea's resize handling (reproduced here with DejaVu fonts and PySide6
  6.12.0, 306,000 layout passes on one panel, gdb showed 10,000 nested resizes). `WrappingRow` now widens back only
  with `WIDEN_SLACK` (16px) to spare; regression test `WrappingRowHysteresisTests`. (2) The "cannot schedule new
  futures after shutdown" traces all came from `compact_display_cache` after the window closed; guarded. (3)
  `tests.test_carddisplay.CardDisplayAgreementTests` carries `needs_wgpu`. (4) `tests/test_tracker_completion.py`
  pins its old-document version to 15 instead of `SCHEMA_VERSION-1`.
- **Tested:** 31 targeted modules one interpreter each, with and without a wgpu-hiding shim, all OK; card tests also on
  the Radeon and llvmpipe through force-adapter.py; batch 20 of CI's run under DejaVu fonts with PySide6 6.12.0 offscreen
  and the slider/colour-picker modules on a private Xvfb display. Report: `scratch/nb-lanes/run/report-L2.md`.
- **Not done:** not pushed; no full suite; no Windows run; no real-display visual QA.

## 2026-10-19 — continuous mode merge: Lane 2 (2D parity, Claude Sonnet 5.5) VP1 of 2: opt-in retained-texture 2D viewer vertical slice (finish 1) (integrator tick)

## 2026-10-19 — continuous mode merge: Lane 4 (Rendering, Claude Sonnet 5.5) step H1 of 2: a denoised 1080p first look within one second (integrator tick)

- **What was done:** `main` `e08cc94e` -> `0a89b108` plus this docs commit. Evidence and per-lane commit
  list in the dated `context/state.md` section. Full suite at `0a89b108`: Ran 5547 tests in 21350.370 s, OK (skipped=1), exit 0.
- **Not done:** visual QA; CI not read; no Windows run.
