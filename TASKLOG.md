# NodeBased task log

## 2026-09-09 — M0 native 2D foundation

- **What was done (evidence):** Built a Qt desktop graph/viewer/inspector and a
  separate validated command/document layer. Seven NumPy scene-linear,
  premultiplied float32 image nodes; PNG/JPEG input, PNG export; bounded retained
  LRU; background previews; undo/redo; portable atomic project persistence;
  opt-in local agent bridge and headless command/render CLI. Recorded the full
  2D → lightweight 3D → procedural/AI → controlled-video → macOS roadmap.
- **Verification:** 19 local unittest checks pass on Linux with Qt 6.11.2,
  NumPy 2.4.6 and `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`. Checks include graph rollback,
  alpha/HDR math, cache invalidation, file round-trip, real Qt port mouse clicks,
  properties and keyboard changes, live local-socket edits/undo and stale preview
  rejection. Separate subprocess CLI create/view/render/save passed. Inspected
  the actual offscreen desktop screenshot. No native display/GPU QA performed.
- **Artifacts/status:** Repository files in `projects/nodebased/` are intended
  committed/pushed deliverables on `neodimo/NodeBased` main. Screenshot
  `projects/nodebased/artifacts/desktop.png` is deliberate ignored local test
  evidence; reproducible via `NODEBASED_SCREENSHOT` and uploaded by CI. No other
  runtime scratch requires cleanup. Windows/Linux workflow is
  `.github/workflows/checks.yml`; remote outcome recorded in `context/state.md`.
- **State:** M0 implemented and locally tested; overall DCC **partial**. Windows
  validation pending remote CI at this entry. No production-performance claims:
  full-frame CPU working memory is not bounded, export is synchronous, decode
  assumes 8-bit sRGB, no EXR/OCIO/sequences/3D/model execution/installers yet.
- **Next owner + concrete artifact:** Gonzo verifies CI and records its exact
  result in `context/state.md`. Omid can launch with `uv run nodebased` from the
  repo, or use README's Python setup. Next scoped implementation comes from
  `docs/VISION.md` M1 after artist feedback on the running shell.
- **Failure modes captured:** Qt scene lifetime must be parent-owned; a temporary
  unparented QGraphicsScene was collected and broke first launch (fixed). Defer
  graph/editor rebuilds beyond event delivery to avoid deleting active Qt items.
  Offscreen rendering verifies neither native desktop feel nor GPU performance.
  The status question arrived while tests/CI were still unwritten and files
  uncommitted: report those distinctions explicitly, not merely "working".
