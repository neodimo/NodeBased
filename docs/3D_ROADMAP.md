# NodeBased 3D roadmap

Status: authorized development, 2026-09-18. This document is a plan, not a list
of shipped capabilities. Initial work is isolated on `feature/3d-foundation`
from the workspace/layout release. Parent owns review and integration.

## Product target

A compositing-first 3D/2.5D workspace with an interactive viewport and a camera
render that feeds the ordinary image graph and Write. User scope additionally
includes Gaussian splats, ray tracing, particles and fluid simulation. Full
Nuke 17.1 parity is a multi-milestone target requiring a feature-by-feature audit;
neither a mesh viewer nor empty node types satisfy it.

## Verified reference baseline

Foundry's 17.1 release notes document Gaussian-splat relighting and shadows,
animated splat import through GeoSequencer, splat export, Hydra 2.0 delegates,
USD layer composition and render outputs. GeoRender accepts scene and camera
inputs, supports delegate-specific settings/AOVs, and renders USD materials
(not Nuke materials). These are separate requirements, not synonyms for drawing
triangles. Legacy projection, particles, deep and geometry workflows still need
an inventory; fluid simulation is an explicit user request regardless of parity.

## Architecture boundaries

- Keep UI/orchestration in Python; use compiled/GPU engines for expensive
  rendering and simulation. A reference rasterizer can establish correctness
  but must be labeled honestly and cannot substantiate performance claims.
- Distinguish typed image, geometry, scene and camera connections. Reject invalid
  connections without damaging documents. Maintain schema migrations, undo,
  animation and the agent protocol alongside UI changes.
- Separate editor navigation from authored render cameras. Orbiting a viewport
  must not silently edit a camera or invalidate the final image.
- Render scene-linear premultiplied float32 RGBA into the existing pipeline.
  Display transforms occur once, in the viewer. Image export retains graph
  precision; any reduced-precision preview/cache needs explicit provenance.
- Scene identity must include time, upstream geometry/material/image inputs,
  camera, lighting, settings and resolved asset identity. Navigation-only state
  must not invalidate image caches. Cancellation and memory budgets are required.
- Preserve an interchange boundary for USD and native render delegates rather
  than coupling all future features to a first-stage mesh implementation.
  USD/Hydra adoption requires packaging, license and Windows/Linux viability
  experiments before making it a mandatory dependency.

## Milestones and release gates

### 1. Usable foundation (implementation underway)
Scene assembly, camera, transforms, basic card/cube geometry, navigable viewport
with grid/axes, and camera render into the 2D graph/Write. Textured cards if ready.
Gate: actual rendered pixel assertions, occlusion/camera/transform tests,
invalid connection rejection, old-document loading, undo/redo, live orbit/pan/
dolly/frame interaction, and an exported image matching the chosen render tree.
Record remaining limitations and backend in release notes.

### 2. Production 2.5D and interchange
Image cards, camera projection, camera/geometry animation, scene hierarchy,
geometry import/export and a tested USD subset. Define units, handedness, axis,
lens/filmback, image origin and alpha conventions before import adapters.
Gate: known camera/projection fixtures, animated round trips, missing assets,
cache invalidation and textured-card color/alpha correctness.

### 3. Lighting and rendering
Materials, lights, shadows, motion blur, depth of field and named AOVs; integrate
a viable compiled ray/path-tracing backend after an actual packaging spike.
Keep interactive preview and final-render quality explicitly distinguishable.
Gate: convergent reference scenes, cancellation, deterministic seeds where
supported, transparent/holdout correctness, memory limits and real GPU timings.
Deep output is a separate audited capability, never inferred from a depth AOV.

### 4. Gaussian splats
Import supported splat representations with covariance/opacity/color preserved,
camera-correct anisotropic rendering and mesh/splat depth interaction. Then
animated sequences, exports, relighting and shadow controls.
Gate: reference assets and images, transparent compositing, ordering artifacts,
animation identity, bounded memory and measured throughput. A point cloud is
not equivalent to a Gaussian-splat renderer.

### 5. Particles and volumes/fluids
Deterministic emitters, forces, collisions, instancing and disk-backed simulation
caches. Separate importing/rendering simulation caches from actually solving
fluids. Evaluate an established solver/volume ecosystem before committing to a
custom solver; support scrubbing through cached simulation without re-solving.
Gate: reproducible seeds, timestep handling, restart/checkpoint behavior,
collision fixtures, simulation invalidation, cancellation and resource budgets.

### 6. Parity audit and extensions
Maintain supported/partial/missing rows against verified Nuke 17.1 workflows,
with a runnable acceptance scene per claimed feature. Compare rendering quality
and throughput under equivalent settings/hardware; no blanket "better renderer"
claim without published measurements. Full parity remains unverified until the
audit closes, including applicable legacy workflows.

## Current handoff

Luna owns foundation code/tests in this worktree. Parent owns this roadmap,
review, real-display verification and eventual integration. The active workspace
release owns main; do not merge or tag around it without checking its state.
Splats, ray tracing, USD interchange, particles and fluids are planned, not
implemented by writing this document. Next artifact: foundation commit plus
test and display evidence in TASKLOG.md and context/state.md.
